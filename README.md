It's a hardware-based text summarizer project using a Raspberry Pi involves using the popular single-board computer as the foundation for a dedicated device that generates summaries of text documents. This project would require expertise in both software and hardware development, as well as an understanding of NLP and machine learning techniques. The project requires the integration of software, including NLP and machine learning algorithms, with the Raspberry Pi's hardware components to create a system that can process input text and produce a concise summary in real-time. The output of the summarizer can be displayed on an attached screen and convert summaries in voice form. This project convert summaries into native language like hindi. This project is a cost-effective solution for creating a custom hardware-based summarizer, leveraging the versatility and accessibility of the Raspberry Pi platform.
